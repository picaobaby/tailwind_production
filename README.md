# Let's Build: With Tailwind CSS - Movie Production Landing Page

This project is the final result of creating a movie production landing page replica of a popular theme on Wix.com. It's merely an experiment to showcase what's possible with Tailwind CSS. You can watch me code it from scratch here:

[https://web-crunch.com/tailwind-css-movie-production-landing-page](https://web-crunch.com/tailwind-css-movie-production-landing-page)


To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/justalever/tailwind-production-landing-page

    cd tailwind-production-lading-page
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run serve

    # Using Yarn
    yarn run serve
    ```

    Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

4. Open `public/index.html` in your editor and start experimenting!

## Building for production

Even though this isn't necessarily a starter kit for a proper project, we've included an example of setting up both [Purgecss](https://www.purgecss.com/) and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) to optimize your CSS for production.

To build an optimized version of your CSS, simply run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production

# Using Yarn
yarn run production
```

After that's done, check out `./public/build/tailwind.css` to see the optimized output.
